	<h1>The breakup of Pangeas</h1>
</center>

<h1>There are several theories about the breakup of Pangea, but the most widely accepted one is that it was caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates. Over millions of years, the plates shifted and moved apart, causing the supercontinent to break up into smaller landmasses.
This process led to the formation of the continents we know today, including North and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The movement of the plates also caused the formation of mountain ranges, such as the Andes and the Himalayas.</h1>
